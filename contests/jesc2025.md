I will try to update this post as soon as I can after any events take place. If you have any questions, suggestions, or if any links are geoblocked or get taken down (which happens sometimes, as broadcasters may want to limit storage costs by making broadcasts time-sensitive), feel free to reach out to me and I can re-upload them somewhere else.

You can contact me by messaging me on Discord (where I am `@teiraa`, you may find me on [discord.gg/eurovision](https://discord.gg/eurovision)), or on Bluesky (`teiraa.bsky.social`). [Thanks for reading so far!](https://imgur.com/YmGlJ4X)
